Driver Distraction Detection Application
ADAS is part of the active safety systems that interact to a larger extent with drivers to help them avoid traffic accidents. The goal of such systems is to contribute to the reduction of traffic accidents by means of new technologies; that is, incorporating new systems for increasing vehicle security, and at the same time, decreasing danger situations that may arise during driving, due to human errors. In this scenario, vehicle security research is focused on driver analysis. In this particular research, a more in-depth analysis of drowsiness and distraction is presented
